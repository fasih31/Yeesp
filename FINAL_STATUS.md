   - Ensure proper session expiration
   - Refresh tokens
   - CSRF protection verification

3. **Rate Limiting**
   - Add rate limiting to all API routes
   - Prevent spam and abuse

### Code Quality
1. **Error Handling**
   - Add error boundaries to all major page groups
   - Better error messages for users
   - Logging system

2. **Loading States**
   - Add skeletons for better UX
   - Loading spinners are basic
