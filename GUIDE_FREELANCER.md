Hi [Client Name],

I'm excited about your React web application project. I have 5 years of experience building similar e-commerce platforms, and your requirements align perfectly with my expertise.

EXPERIENCE:
I've completed 15+ React projects, including 3 full e-commerce platforms. You can see examples in my portfolio, particularly "ShopEase" which has similar features.

APPROACH:
I'll use React with TypeScript for type safety, Redux for state management, and Stripe for payments. Development in 4 sprints with weekly demos for your feedback.

TIMELINE & BUDGET:
I can deliver within your 6-week deadline for $4,500. This includes all features, testing, deployment, and 2 weeks of post-launch support.

I'd love to discuss your project further. When works for a brief call?

Best regards,
[Your Name]
