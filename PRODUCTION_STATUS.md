## üîê SECURITY IMPLEMENTATIONS

### ‚úÖ Completed Security Measures
1. **Route Protection:** All sensitive API endpoints protected with authentication middleware
2. **Role-Based Access:** Routes restricted by user role (admin, tutor, student, freelancer, recruiter)
3. **Ownership Validation:** Users can only modify their own resources
4. **Automatic ID Assignment:** Foreign keys (instructorId, recruiterId, freelancerId, studentId) derived from session
5. **Admin Authorization:** Admin-only endpoints properly secured
6. **Client-Side Route Guards:** ProtectedRoute component prevents unauthorized dashboard access
7. **Password Security:** Bcrypt hashing for all passwords
8. **SQL Injection Prevention:** Drizzle ORM with parameterized queries
9. **XSS Prevention:** React's built-in sanitization
10. **Input Validation:** Zod schemas on all API inputs

### üîí Security Best Practices Applied
- Session-based authentication
- Environment-based secret management
- CSRF protection via session cookies
- Rate limiting on authentication endpoints
- No sensitive data in client code

## üìã KNOWN LIMITATIONS

### Non-Production Services
1. **Mock PDF Generation:** Certificates generate placeholder PDFs (functional structure, needs styling)
2. **Email Testing Required:** SendGrid configured but needs verification
3. **Payment Testing Required:** Stripe configured but needs end-to-end testing
4. **Video Calls:** UI components need completion

### Frontend Placeholder Data
