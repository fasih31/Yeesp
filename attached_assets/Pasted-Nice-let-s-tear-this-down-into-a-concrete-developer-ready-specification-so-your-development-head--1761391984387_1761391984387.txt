Nice — let’s tear this down into a concrete, developer-ready specification so your development head can start building immediately. I’ll list what each role needs (fields + UI elements + actions), the validations required, interconnections between modules, example DB tables, API endpoints, workflows, and priority (MVP vs. later).

I’ll keep it practical and prioritized so engineers can implement in sprints.

Overall common foundation (applies to all roles)

Auth & security
	•	JWT access + refresh tokens, session expiry, optional 2FA (email/SMS).
	•	OAuth login (Google, Apple) for fast signup.
	•	Role-based access control (RBAC): student, tutor, freelancer, recruiter, admin, superadmin.
	•	Audit logs for sensitive actions (payment changes, KYC approvals, certificate issuance).
	•	Rate limiting on critical endpoints and file uploads.

Data/Storage
	•	Primary DB: PostgreSQL.
	•	Cache: Redis (session, rate-limit counters).
	•	File storage: S3-compatible (videos, CVs, certificates, assignments).
	•	Search: Elastic/Algolia for fast tutor/course/project search.

Common validations
	•	Strong email validation (verify by sending code).
	•	Phone number normalized (E.164) + SMS verification.
	•	File type & size restrictions (videos, images, docs).
	•	XSS/CSRF protections on forms.
	•	GDPR/Privacy: explicit consent checkbox on signup + TOS link.

Core Interconnections & Flows (How modules talk to each other)

1) Matchmaking flow (student ↔ tutor ↔ recruiter)
	•	Event: Student specifies need (e.g., weekly tutoring in React).
	•	System:
	•	Use student.preferences + skill tags + timezone to query tutor index.
	•	Rank by availability, rating, price, verification status.
	•	Present top N tutors; offer book now or request a trial.
	•	Validation: booking conflict detection, payment authorization if required.

2) Learn → Earn (student to freelancer)
	•	Trigger: Student completes course(s) & meets grade/portfolio requirements.
	•	System:
	•	Automatically create freelancer profile draft populated with certificates & sample projects.
	•	Send onboarding flow: set rates, add payout, accept T&Cs.
	•	Optionally auto-apply to matching starter gigs or allow recruiter invites.
	•	Validation: prevent auto-activation for accounts without KYC if gig budget > threshold.

3) Course Update Notification
	•	Admin or tutor publishes updated content.
	•	System:
	•	Create a new course_version, notify enrolled students with diff summary.
	•	For certified courses, mark if recertification required and schedule update webinar automatically.

4) Payments & Escrow
	•	Payments for courses, tutoring sessions, and freelancer marketplace all go via unified payments module.
	•	Rules:
	•	Course payments: immediate capture, platform fee applied, tutor revenue share scheduled.
	•	Tutoring sessions: pre-authorization or capture depending on policy; refunds per cancellation policy.
	•	Freelance projects: escrow deposit required; milestone release on client approval or auto-release if no dispute within N days.

5) Certificates & Credibility
	•	Certificates contain: cert id, student, course_id, grade, issue_date, issuer.
	•	Optionally anchor certificate hash on VirtualIEC blockchain for immutability (later enhancement).
	•	Certificates feed recruiter filters and search ranking.

	•	Course prerequisites: Enforce prerequisite completion before enrolling in advanced courses.
	•	Tutor availability timezone normalization: All times stored in UTC; UI shows localized times; confirmation email contains both local & UTC time.
	•	Payment currency mismatch: Normalize via platform currency; show both estimated conversions at checkout with rate & timestamp.
	•	Certificate revocation: Admin can revoke certificate; store revoked_at with reason; notify recruiters who viewed it in last X days.
